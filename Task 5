5. Error Handling in Node.js
Scenario: You have the following Node.js function that processes a user login request:
 

1.	How would you improve the error handling in this function to provide more specific error responses to the client?
1. Improving Error Handling
Here’s how you might structure your login function to enhance error handling:
javascript
Copy code
async function login(username, password) {
    try {
        const user = await findUserByUsername(username);
        if (!user) {
            throw new Error('USER_NOT_FOUND');
        }
        const isValidPassword = await verifyPassword(user.password, password);
        if (!isValidPassword) {
            throw new Error('INVALID_PASSWORD');
        }
        const token = generateToken(user);
        return { success: true, token };
        
    } catch (error) {
        handleLoginError(error);
    }
}
function handleLoginError(error) {
    switch (error.message) {
        case 'USER_NOT_FOUND':
            return { status: 404, message: 'User not found.' };
        case 'INVALID_PASSWORD':
            return { status: 401, message: 'Invalid password.' };
        default:
            return { status: 500, message: 'An unexpected error occurred.' };
    }
}
Key Improvements:
•	Specific Error Messages: Instead of a generic error message, specific error messages are thrown for different failure points (USER_NOT_FOUND and INVALID_PASSWORD).
•	Centralized Error Handling: The handleLoginError function centralizes error handling, making it easier to manage different types of errors and their responses.

2.	Explain the importance of differentiating between different types of errors (e.g., user not found vs. invalid password).
Differentiating between various types of errors is crucial for several reasons:
1.	User Experience: Providing specific error messages helps users understand what went wrong. For instance, if a user is informed that their password is incorrect, they can take appropriate action (like trying again). In contrast, a vague error message may lead to frustration.
2.	Security: Specific error messages help prevent information leakage. For example, distinguishing between a user not found and an invalid password can reduce the risk of username enumeration attacks, where an attacker tries to guess valid usernames based on the error responses.
3.	Debugging and Monitoring: Differentiating error types aids developers in identifying issues quickly. For example, if you notice a high number of USER_NOT_FOUND errors in your logs, it may indicate a problem with user registration or data integrity.
4.	API Design: For APIs, returning specific error codes and messages allows clients to handle errors appropriately in their applications. This can facilitate better error handling strategies on the client side.
